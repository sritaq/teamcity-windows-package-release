# TeamCity Windows Package Release 🚀

This project demonstrates a **TeamCity-based Release Engineering workflow**
where a package is built from Git, published as a TeamCity artifact,
and deployed to a **Windows server** using PowerShell.

## Flow
Git → TeamCity Build → Artifacts → TeamCity Deploy → Windows Server

## What this shows
- Artifact-driven releases
- Build & Deploy separation
- Windows-native PowerShell deployment
- Secure, auditable CI/CD practices

See docs/ for step-by-step explanation with screenshots.
